# TerraMaster
Items Added:
* (Security) Certain critical server-management requests are now logged regardless of the configured log level (#13394)
* (Security) Downgrading the server's log level now requires a PMS restart (#13393)
* (Security) Preroll video files now must have a recognized video file extension (#13397)
* (Security) When possible, request logs now include the name of the device associated with the auth token (#13392)

Items Fixed:
* (Collections) Manually ordered items in collections would not always retain their set position (#13350)
* (EPG) Fix parsing XMLTV time including milliseconds (#13353)
* (Linux) The server could exit unexpectedly when processing dates in the distant past with certain time zone configurations (#13371)
* (Music) Improve matching accuracy of multi-disc albums (#13358)
* (Network) The server could react excessively to minor internal network configuration changes, such as those produced by starting and stopping containers (#13351)
